# Exploring-Data-Mining-Techniques-in-COVID-19-Research

The COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented and unpredictable challenges across the world, requiring the deployment of complex data mining techniques to manage and mitigate the impact of the virus. This paper reviews recent research works that apply various data mining methods, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), supervised learning techniques, clustering algorithms, frequent itemsets, and association rules, to address the big data challenges within the healthcare sector during the COVID-19 crisis. By analyzing these methodsâ€™ applications in tracking the virus spread, predicting outcomes, and enhancing healthcare responses, we aim to identify existing data mining problems and propose viable solutions. The insights from this study show the potential of data mining in revolutionizing healthcare monitoring and information technology, particularly in managing pandemic situations
